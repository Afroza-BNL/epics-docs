These instructions apply to OS X 10.6 and higher

- Select the "Firewall" tab
- Open the lock to allow changes
- Ensure that the firewall is on
- Click the "Advanced" button
- Add your EPICS applications (e.g. caRepeater, caget, camonitor, caput, StripTool, edm, soft IOCs, etc.) to the list and set the firewall to "Allow incoming connections" to them
